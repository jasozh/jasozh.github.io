After downloading MuseScore, I began to transcribe a few of my improvisations, and I later added on to these improvisations to turn them into complete scores. I have written over a dozen compositions since then, and you can find a list of my work on my <a href='https://musescore.com/user/38882263'>MuseScore profile</a>.",

Although my writing still leaves much to be desired, I hope to eventually finish a few of my short stories.",
